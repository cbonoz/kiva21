TiVa
---

TiVa is a crypto-powered application inspired by Kiva.org for giving microloans for individuals and businesses in need.

Built for the Kiva 2021 hackathon.

<b>Note this project is currently for demo purposes and would require additional implementation to be production ready.</b>

Key value props:
1. Discover charities and businesses to give support from your TV.
2. Crypto offers minimum friction payments to individuals and businesses anywhere in the world.
3. Create a loan queue that automatically circulates your funds to other businesses once repaid.
